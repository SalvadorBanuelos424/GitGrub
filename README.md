# Park Place Association Website

This website is a potential product we will be pitching to a local community for real use. Allows interaction from employees and customers to view and change reservations and other features later in the future.

## Deployment
https://park-place-association.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

Signup is functional or you can login using the following

```
email: test@test.com
password: password
```

You can view the current calendar setup showing pre entered events. Future versions will allow employees to add events themselves.
